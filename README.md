This project started from the [International Master in Turbulence](https://centralelille.fr/en/aeronautic-space-major-turbulence/
), at Ecole Centrale de Lille, under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Laval, Jean Marc Foucaut and Ilkay Solak.
The code was improved and [validated](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1873-7005/ab7ebf) by Dr. Yann Devaux at Institute Pprime, Poitiers, France.
