Methodology
===========

The methodology used in this work to characterize the coherent structures are
divided in three main steps: the calculation of a local function to detect the
vortex; the localization of the maxima of this function; and the adjustment
(fitting) of this field to the proposed model.

Detection methods
-----------------
In this section, the detection methods implemented in the code for vortex
identification are presented. These methods are based on the velocity gradient
tensor, :math:`\overline{D}`, that can be written as :eq:`eq_tensor_D`


.. math::
   D_{ij} = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}
   :label: eq_tensor_D

As this is a second order tensor, it can be decomposed into a symmetric and
anti-symmetric part, :math:`D_{ij} = S_{ij} + \Omega_{ij}` where:

.. math::
   S_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} +
   \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right)
   :label: eq_tensor_S

.. math::
   \Omega_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} -
   \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right)
   :label: eq_tensor_omega

:math:`S_{ij}` is known as the rate-of-strain tensor :eq:`eq_tensor_S` and :math:`\Omega_{ij}` is the
vorticity tensor :eq:`eq_tensor_omega`.

The characteristic equation for :math:`\bar{D}` is given by :eq:`eq_characteristic_equation` :

.. math::
   \lambda^3 + P \lambda^2 + Q \lambda + R = 0
   :label: eq_characteristic_equation

where P :eq:`eq_P`, Q :eq:`eq_Q` and R :eq:`eq_R` are the three invariants of the velocity gradient tensor. 
Using the decomposition into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, these invariants can be expressed as:

.. math::
   P = -tr(\bar{D})
   :label: eq_P

.. math::
   Q = \frac{1}{2} (tr(\bar{D})^2 -tr(\bar{D}^2)) = \frac{1}{2} (\|\Omega\|^2 -\|S\|^2)
   :label: eq_Q

.. math::
   R = -det(\bar{D})
   :label: eq_R

Q criterion
-----------

The :math:`Q` criterion proposed by Hunt *et al* (1988) [HUNT1988]_ identifies the vortices
as flow regions with positive second invariant of :math:`\bar{D}`. An additional
condition is that the pressure in the eddy region should to be lower than the
ambient pressure. Chakraborty *et al* (2005) [CHAKRA2005]_ quoted "in
an incompressible flow :math:`Q` is a local measure of the excess rotation rate relative
to the strain rate".

In practical terms, the vortex is detected in case of the second invariant  :math:`Q > 0`.

:math:`\Delta` criterion
------------------------

Chong *et al* (1990) [CHONG1990]_ define a vortex core to be the region where 
:math:`\bar{D}` has complex eigenvalues. In order to determine if the eigenvalues
are complex, we examine the discriminant of the characteristic equation :eq:`eq_delta_criterion`, 
considering the flow incompressible (:math:`P = 0`).

.. math::
   \Delta = \left(\frac{Q}{3}\right)^3 + \left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^2 > 0
   :label: eq_delta_criterion

Swirling strength criterion
---------------------------

The swirling strength criterion :math:`\lambda_{ci}` :eq:`eq_lambda`
was developed by Zhou *et al* (1999) [ZHOU1999]_. 
It defines a vortex core to be the region where
:math:`\bar{D}` has complex eigenvalues. It is based on the idea that the
velocity gradient tensor in Cartesian coordinates can be decomposed as:

.. math::
   \bar{D} = [\bar{\nu_r} \bar{\nu_{cr}} \bar{\nu_{ci}}]^T
   \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
   \lambda_r & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \lambda_{cr} & \lambda_{ci} \\
   0 & -\lambda_{ci} & \lambda_{cr} \end{array}\right]
   [\bar{\nu_r} \bar{\nu_{cr}} \bar{\nu_{ci}}]^T
   :label: eq_lambda

where :math:`\lambda_r` is the real eigenvalue, related to the eigenvector
:math:`\bar{\nu_r}`, and the complex conjugate pair of complex eigenvalues is
:math:`\lambda_{cr}  \pm i\lambda_{ci}`, related to the eigenvectors
:math:`\bar{\nu_r} \pm i\bar{\nu_{ci}}`. The strength of this swirling motion can
be quantified by :math:`\lambda_{ci}`, called the local swirling strength of the
vortex. The threshold for :math:`\lambda_{ci}` is not well-defined, but theoretically
any value greater than zero should be considered a vortex. Experimental results
[ZHOU1999]_ shows that :math:`\lambda_{ci} \geq \epsilon > 1.5` give smoother results.


Localization of the extrema
---------------------------

To have smooth results on the swirling strength, we apply a normalization of the
field :eq:`eq_swirling_norm`. The swirling strength is divided by the wall-normal profile of its RMS value:

.. math::
   \bar{\lambda}_{ci}(x_{1/3},x_2) = \frac{\lambda_{ci}(x_{1/3},x_2)}{\lambda_{ci,RMS}(x_2)}
   :label: eq_swirling_norm

Then the local maxima of the detection can be identified. The normalization is
not required for the HIT cases, it is only used when we have an non-homogeneous
direction.

In :numref:`nonnorm2` we see the original swirling strength field, where
104 vortices were found, mostly near the wall, where the boundary layer plays an
important role in increasing the swirling strengtht. The yellow circles corresponds
to the vortices rotating clockwise and the green circles for the counter-clockwise
rotation. 

.. _nonnorm2:
.. figure:: _images/PIVnonnormalized.png
   :alt: non normalized PIV field - Swirling strength detection
   :align: center

In figure :numref:`norm2` we show the fluctuation of the swirling strength field,
by applying the Reynolds decomposition, now with 202 vortices found, minimizing
the wall influence over the detection.

.. _norm2:
.. figure:: _images/PIVnormalized.png
   :alt: normalized PIV field - Swirling strength detection
   :align: center

We can play with the distance between one detected vortex and another, by increasing
the box size of the peak detection. In :numref:`boxnorm2` we set the box size
to 12, instead of box size 6 used in :numref:`nonnorm2` and :numref:`norm2`.
With this setting we reduce the detected vortices to 154, by removing the overlapping
ones.

   :alt: normalized PIV field with boxsize = 12 - Swirling strength detection
   :align: center

One interesting fact about the swirling strength (as well the other methods) is
that the local maximum values does not always match the center of the vortex. We
show in :numref:`quiverDNS1` one example of this mismatch between them.

Fitting of coherent structures
------------------------------

Using the peak of maximum swirling strength or identifying the places where the
Q or :math:`\Delta` criterion are higher than 0 gives us a rough estimation of a possible
vortex and its center. But even using a threshold on these methods, the presence
of a real vortex is not always true. To improve this detection we use a Lamb-Oseen
vortex model to be fitted on top of the actual detected peak to check if it is
really a vortex. 


Lamb-Oseen vortex
-----------------

The Lamb-Oseen vortex is a mathematical model for the flow velocity in the
circumferential direction (:math:`\vec{e_\theta}`), shown below. It
models a line vortex that decays due to viscosity.

.. math::
   \vec{u}_\theta(r,t) = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r} \left[ 1 - \exp \left(
   -\left(\frac{r}{r_0(t)}\right)^2\right)\right] \vec{e}_{\theta}
   :label: eq_oseenDecay

where :math:`r` is the radius, :math:`r_0 = \sqrt{4 \nu t}` is the core radius of vortex,
:math:`\nu` is the viscosity and :math:`\Gamma` is the circulation contained in the vortex. 

Since the coherent structures are in movement, we add the
advective velocity :math:`\vec{u_a}` to the Lamb-Oseen vortex model shown below.  

.. math::
   \vec{u}_\theta(r,t) = \vec{u}_a + \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r} \left[ 1 - \exp \left(
   -\left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^2\right)\right] \vec{e}_{\theta}
   :label: eq_oseen

The correlation coefficient between the fitted model and the velocity field is calculated 
according to equation :eq:`eq_corr_ua` and if it's higher than a chosen threshold 
(typically 0.75), we can consider it a vortex.


.. math::
   R(model/data) = \left( \frac{\langle (\vec{u}_{data}-\vec{u}_a).(\vec{u}_{model}
   -\vec{u}_a)\rangle }{\sqrt{\langle (\vec{u}_{data}-\vec{u}_a)^2\rangle}
   \sqrt{\langle (\vec{u}_{model}-\vec{u}_a)^2\rangle}} \right)^{1/2}
   :label: eq_corr_ua

Non-linear least squares
------------------------

Levenberg Marquardt method
``````````````````````````

The Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm, also known as the damped least-squares method,
is used to solve non-linear least squares problems. These minimization problems
arise especially in least squares curve fitting.

.. math::
   \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ \frac{y_i - \sum_{k=1}^M a_k X_k (x_i)}{\sigma i} \right]^2

.. math::
   \alpha_{kl} = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2} \left[ \frac{\partial y(x_i;a)}{\partial a_k} \frac{\partial y(x_i;a)}{\partial a_l} \right]


Powell's dogleg method
``````````````````````

The Powell's method is an algorithm for finding a local minimum of a function.
This function doesn't need to be differentiable and no derivatives are taken. It
does this using a combination of Newton's method and the steepest descent method.
This is a so-called trust region method. This means that every step moves the
current point to within a finite region. This makes the method more stable than
Newton's method.


Validation
----------

In this section, the fitting of the Lamb-Oseen vortex model is tested under different scenarios.
For the first comparison a standard Lamb-Oseen vortex is created and VortexFitting tries to estimate its parameters.
Four different cases (:numref:`CaseA`, :numref:`CaseB`, :numref:`CaseC` and :numref:`CaseD`), varying the core radius, the circulation $\Gamma$ and the distance of the center of vortex to the center of window (shift), are presented.

.. _CaseA:
.. figure:: _images/test_02_10.png
   :width: 45 %
   :alt: Case A - core radius = 0.2, Gamma = 10, x/y shift = 0
   :align: center

   Case A - core radius = 0.2, :math:`\Gamma = 10`, x/y shift = 0

.. _CaseB:
.. figure:: _images/test_02_10_02.png
   :width: 45 %
   :alt: Case B - core radius = 0.2, Gamma = 10, x/y shift = 0.2
   :align: center

   Case B - core radius = 0.2, :math:`\Gamma = 10`, x/y shift = 0.2
   
.. _CaseC:   
.. figure:: _images/test_09_40.png
   :width: 45 %
   :alt: Case C - core radius = 0.9, :math:`\Gamma = 40`, x/y shift = 0
   :align: center

   Case C - core radius = 0.9, Gamma = 40, x/y shift = 0

.. _CaseD:   
.. figure:: _images/test_09_40_02.png
   :width: 45 %
   :alt: Case D - core radius = 0.9, Gamma = 40, x/y shift = 0.2
   :align: center

   Case D - core radius = 0.9, :math:`\Gamma = 40`, x/y shift = 0.2

:numref:`TableCases` presents the fitting results: the guess is exact for all the cases (correlation = 1), as the data and model vectors totally overlaps themselves.

For the second set of tests, a random noise is added to the original vortex field, creating a perturbation to the initial flow field.
The fitting provides the results in :numref:`TableCases2`, corresponding to for cases (:numref:`CaseA2`, :numref:`CaseB2`, :numref:`CaseC2` and :numref:`CaseD2`).
We can see a better correlation for the stronger vortices (higher circulation), meaning that they are less affected by the perturbation.
